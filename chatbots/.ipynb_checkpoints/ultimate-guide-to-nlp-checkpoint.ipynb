    "According to industry estimates, only 21% of the available data is present in structured form. Data is being generated as we speak, as we tweet, as we send messages on Whatsapp and in various other activities. Majority of this data exists in the textual form, which is highly unstructured in nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Few notorious examples include – tweets / posts on social media, user to user chat conversations, news, blogs and articles, product or services reviews and patient records in the healthcare sector. A few more recent ones includes chatbots and other voice driven bots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite having high dimension data, the information present in it is not directly accessible unless it is processed (read and understood) manually or analyzed by an automated system.\n",

    "In order to produce significant and actionable insights from text data, it is important to get acquainted with the techniques and principles of Natural Language Processing (NLP).\n",

    "So, if you plan to create chatbots this year, or you want to use the power of unstructured text, this guide is the right starting point. This guide unearths the concepts of natural language processing, its techniques and implementation. The aim of the article is to teach the concepts of natural language processing and apply it on real data set.\n"

    "\n",
    "1. Word sense disambiguation: Some language words have multiple meanings according to their usage. For example, in the two sentences below:\n",
    "\n",
    "I. “Please book my flight for Delhi”\n",
    "\n",
    "II. “I am going to read this book in the flight”\n",

    "\n",
    "B. Improving word-based features: A learning model could learn different contexts of a word when used word as the features, however if the part of speech tag is linked with them, the context is preserved, thus making strong features. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence -“book my flight, I will read this book”\n",
    "\n",

    "C. Normalization and Lemmatization: POS tags are the basis of lemmatization process for converting a word to its base form (lemma).\n",

    "D. Efficient stopword removal : P OS tags are also useful in efficient removal of stopwords.\n",
    "\n",

    "Noun phrase identification: This step deals with extracting all the noun phrases from a text using dependency parsing and part of speech tagging.\n",

    "Phrase classification: This is the classification step in which all the extracted noun phrases are classified into respective categories (locations, names etc). Google Maps API provides a good path to disambiguate locations, Then, the open databases from dbpedia, wikipedia can be used to identify person names or company names. Apart from this, one can curate the lookup tables and dictionaries by combining information from different sources.\n",
