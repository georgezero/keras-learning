    "In practice, very few people train an entire Convolutional Network from scratch (with random initialization), because it is relatively rare to have a dataset of sufficient size. Instead, it is common to pretrain a ConvNet on a very large dataset (e.g. ImageNet, which contains 1.2 million images with 1000 categories), and then use the ConvNet either as an initialization or a fixed feature extractor for the task of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two major transfer learning scenarios looks as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fine tuneing the convnet\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of random initialization, we initialize the network with a pretrained network, like the one that is trained on imagenet 1000 dataset.  Rest of the training looks as usual.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ConvNet as fixed feature extractor\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will freeze the weights for all of the network except that of the final fully connected layer.  This last fully connected layer is replaced with a new one with random weights and only this layer is trained.\n",

Usually, this is a very small dataset to generalize upon, if trained from scratch. Since we are using transfer learning, we should be able to generalize reasonably well.\n",
